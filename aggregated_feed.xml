      <description>Firewall Policy is the recommended method to manage Azure Firewall security and operational configurations. When using Firewall Policy, any rules must be part of a rule collection and rule collection group. Rule collections are sets of rules that share the same priority and action, and can be of type DNAT, Network, or Application. Rule collection groups are containers for rule collections of any type and are processed first by Azure Firewall based on priority. To learn more about rules, rule collections, and rule collections groups, see Azure Firewall Policy rule sets.

      <description>Hi everyone! Brandon Wilson here once again with this month&#8217;s &#8220;Check This Out!&#8221; (CTO!) guide.
These posts are only intended to be your guide, to lead you to some content of interest, and are just a way we are trying to help our readers a bit more, whether that is learning, troubleshooting, or just finding new content sources! We will give you a bit of a taste of the blog content itself, provide you a way to get to the source content directly, and help to introduce you to some other blogs you may not be aware of that you might find helpful.
From all of us on the Core Infrastructure and Security...</description>

      <description>Microsoft Purview Data owner policies is a cloud-based service that helps you provision access to data sources and datasets securely and at scale. Data owner policies expose a REST API through which you can grant any Azure AD identity (user, group or service principal) to have Read or Modify access to a dataset or data resource. The scope for the access can range from fine-grained (e.g., Table or File) to broad (e.g., entire Azure Resource Group or Subscription).&#160;This API provides a consistent interface that abstracts the complexity of permissions for each type of data source.

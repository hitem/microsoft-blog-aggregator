      <description>Introduction&#160;
During a forensic investigation, malicious activity may be discovered in logs. An incident responder may want to identify related malicious activity across a range of related log files. Typically, responders would extract and search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) or write well-crafted queries to search logs for similar activity. One way we can help responders find this similar activity is using &#8220;fuzzy hashing&#8221;, a term that encompasses a range of different hashing techniques designed to broadly group together &#8220;similar&#8221; things (in this case, similar malicious activity.)

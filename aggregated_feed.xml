      <description>We are excited to announce that Microsoft Purview has extended the support of Sensitive info types (SITs) to Azure and 3P data assets in the Data Map/Catalog. Before this release, SITs could only be applied at file level. Now, SITs can be applied more granularly, i.e., at column level, for structured non-M365 assets. This capability is now available as a Preview to new Microsoft Purview Data Map customers. Existing Microsoft Purview Data Map customers will be offered this capability at a later point.

With this new capability, you will be able to apply SITs to Azure and 3P data objects manual...</description>

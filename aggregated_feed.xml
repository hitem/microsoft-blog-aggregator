Watchlists
Watchlists are a feature of Microsoft Sentinel that provide great flexibility and useability.&#160; They allow for user-defined tables that can be used in KQL queries to provide additional data.&#160; By uploading data using CSV files, users control the data that are in the watchlists and that data can be modified and new rows added as needed.
